# Space Explorers **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**
This is a landing page for a fictional space company to explore the universe.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to enhance my skills with CSS keyframe animations by creating a dynamic and visually appealing landing page for a fictional space exploration company. This project allowed me to experiment with various animation techniques to better understand their application and behavior. It also served as an opportunity to practice integrating animations into a cohesive design.

## Tecnologies
**Front-end:** ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-%20?style=for-the-badge&color=orange) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-%20?style=for-the-badge&color=blue) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAVASCRIPT-%20?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black&color=%23EFD81E)

## Lessons learned & challenges
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of keyframe animations, a topic that had been unclear to me.

Challenges:
* Complex Animations: Some animations were particularly challenging as I had no idea how to implement them initially.
Solutions:
* In some cases, I combined two animations simultaneously to achieve a specific behavior.
* In other cases, I learned how to precisely move assets around the screen.
In the end, I can confidently say that most animations are very close to what I envisioned.

## How to use
Link for the project on github pages.

## Notes
The animations that I didn't made myself are from [AOS library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). I primarily used it for text content and to display certain elements on the screen.
